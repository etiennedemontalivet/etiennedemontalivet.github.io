  abstract    = {In the last decade, notable progress in mechatronics paved the way for a new generation of arm prostheses, expanding motor capabilities thanks to their multiple active joints. Yet, the design of control schemes for these advanced devices still poses a challenge, especially with the limited availability of command signals for higher levels of arm impairment. When addressing this challenge, current commercial devices lack versatility and customizing options to be employed as test-beds for developing novel control schemes. As a consequence, researchers resort to using lab-specific experimental apparatuses on which to deploy their innovations, such as virtual reality setups or mock prosthetic devices worn by unimpaired participants.
To meet this need for a test-bed, we developed the Smart Arm platform, a human-like, multi-articulated robotic arm that can be worn as a trans-humeral arm prosthesis. The design process followed three principles: provide a reprogrammable embedded system allowing in-depth customization of control schemes, favor easy-to-buy parts rather than custom-made components, and guarantee compatibility with industrial standards in prosthetics.
The Smart ArM platform includes motorized elbow and wrist joints while being compatible with commercial prosthetic hands. Its software and electronic architecture can be easily adapted to build devices with a wide variety of sensors and actuators. This platform was employed in several experiments studying arm prosthesis control and sensory feedback. We also report our participation in Cybathlon, where our pilot with forearm agenesia successfully drives the Smart Arm prosthesis to perform activities of daily living requiring both strength and dexterity.
These application scenarios illustrate the versatility and adaptability of the proposed platform, for research purposes as well as outside the lab. The Smart Arm platform offers a test-bed for experimenting with prosthetic control laws and command signals, suitable for running tests in lifelike settings where impaired participants wear it as a prosthetic device. In this way, we aim at bridging a critical gap in the field of upper limb prosthetics: the need for realistic, ecological test conditions to assess the actual benefit of a technological innovation for the end-users.},

  abstract  = {Upper limb (UL) assistive robots, such as exoskeletons, prostheses or supernumerary limbs, can rarely be fully autonomous devices. Indeed, it is generally not possible to use pre-defined patterns of motions because of the great diversity of tasks and the variety of UL movement strategies to achieve any of them. Control has to be provided to the users. For that purpose, the most widespread solutions to obtain user’s motor intention use physiological signals (electromyograms or electroencephalograms e.g.), distal functional joints (for instance, head or foot motions control the end-effector position and/or orientation) or inter-joint synergies models[5]. Despite interesting results, they all still have important limitations: the first two are neither natural nor intuitive and suffer from robustness issues, the third one does not allow very versatile devices. To tackle these issues, we propose a new control approach, together with a new paradigm, that uses the motion strategies naturally developed by the Central Nervous System (CNS). When a limb mobility is reduced, or when an assistive device does not work properly, CNS compensates and takes advantage of motor redundancy of the body: it calls other joints to still perform the desired gesture. Typical compensatory joints for UL movements are the trunk and the scapula. Our concept is to servo the robot to these body compensations. The only task of the latter is to make its user come back to a comfortable posture, and this indirectly leads to the realisation of the intended motion. The reciprocal adaptation between human and robot allows both to reduce the body compensations and perform UL movements with the assistive device. We validated a proof of concept of this paradigm on ten healthy subjects who executed a path-tracking task with an elbow exoskeleton.

abstract = {Introduction/Background
Common myoelectric control strategy remains complex to use and produce unnatural gestures since it does not allow simultaneous movements of several joints. This is especially an issue for the transhumeral amputees who can use an active elbow in addition to active prosthetic wrist and hand. Since most transhumeral amputees have a mobile residual limb, an interesting approach aims at utilizing this mobility to control the elbow. We thus developed a simple electronic device relying on an inertial measurement unit, that can be interfaced with existing commercial myoelectric elbows and which convert chosen displacements of the residual limb into control signals, offering an intuitive way of controlling an active elbow prosthesis whilst allowing a simultaneous myoelectric control of the wrist and hand.
Material and method
We performed an experiment with one transhumeral amputee wearing his myoelectric prosthetic (active elbow, wrist and hand) who was asked to grasp and transfer different objects several times while being recorded with a motion capture system. Theses task were performed twice: with a conventional full myoelectric control and with the proposed movement based control. Several metrics (position error, time, smoothness, along with body compensatory strategies) were used to quantify the performances obtained with these two modes.
Results
Analyses showed that the participant was able to perform the tasks in both condition, but that the movement based control approach allowed a reduction in task time and in exhibited body compensatory strategies, by offering an easier access to adjustments of the elbow posture compared to the full myoelectric control approach.
Conclusion
This work illustrates the potential of using residual limb mobility in the control of prosthetics, to make it more natural and intuitive, and how this can have an indirect but positive impact on the whole body compensatory strategies exhibited by amputated subjects.}

abstract = {Introduction/Background
There is a gap between the technical capability of upper limb prostheses, and the control strategy (commonly sequential myoelectric control) used to actuate the motorized joints. Surprisingly, the control method is the same for prosthetic hands and hand/wrist/elbow systems, which leads to a complex utilization. Research groups are investigating new control strategies to make the prosthetic control easier. Most studies are focusing on the task achievement, but it is nonetheless essential to assess the achievement method, especially since high-level amputees are prone to develop compensation-related musculoskeletal disorders. The study aims to show that body kinematics can be used to compare different control strategies, or prosthetic equipments.
Material and method
Transhumeral amputees performed a reaching task with different prosthetic parameters (different sockets, different control strategies). They performed the task with a prosthesis prototype that could be adapted to any socket, and implemented with any control strategy. They were equipped with motion capture sensors in order to record their body kinematics. The body motion analysis included the trunk and shoulder displacements, as well as the weight deviation.
Results
We could observe that each transhumeral amputee had a unique utilization of their prosthesis, and that they had their own residual capabilities. All the participants performed the task with the two tested control strategies successfully. However, the kinematic analysis showed differences between the control strategies in terms of coordination restauration, that the participants described but that the task assessment (success or not) could not provide.
Conclusion
Differences could be highlighted between control strategies that the standard assessment method could not show. Hence the whole body kinematics can be a substantial source of information, especially given the potential severity of compensatory strategies in upper limb prosthesis utilization.}

abstract = {Objective
Most transhumeral amputees deplore that their prosthesis lacks functionality due to control-related limitations. Externally powered prosthetic devices are commonly controlled via myoelectric control whereby biceps and triceps contractions drive sequentially the prosthetic joints. Because of a complex control scheme, transhumeral amputees are generally equipped with a 1-degree-of-freedom myoelectric hand, a myoelectric wrist rotator, and a manually locked elbow, despite the commercialization of more advanced devices. This results in the development of compensatory strategies to overcome the prosthesis’ lack of mobility. An alternative control strategy relates the residual limb motions to the prosthetic elbow motion using the natural coordination between shoulder and elbow observed in healthy movements. However, conventional external sockets tend to prevent the residual limb mobility, limiting the potentiality of this novel control strategy. Osseo-integration enables a stable attachment of the prosthetic device and frees the residual limb. This study focuses on the performance of three osseo-integrated patients using an automatically driven prosthesis.
Material/patients and methods
A prosthesis prototype including a myoelectric hand, a wrist rotator, and a motorized elbow was mounted on the participants’ abutment from the osseo-integrated implant system. The subjects were asked to point at targets while the motorized elbow was controlled by residual limb movements based on a model of healthy shoulder/elbow coordination. For comparison purposes, the task was also performed with conventional sequential myoelectric control. Body movements were assessed with the data recorded with a motion capture system.
Results
Large trunk compensatory movements were measured during pointing gesture with a myoelectrically driven elbow. Automatic control of the elbow enabled a more natural body behavior whereby the trunk displacements were small, and the shoulder and the prosthetic elbow were moving synchronously.
Discussion – conclusion
The study shows that osseo-integration made possible residual limb movements of large amplitudes, allowing the participants to achieve the pointing task with a prosthetic elbow driven by the residual limb motions. Moreover, simultaneous control of elbow and end-effector was achieved by one subject. Hence, this work highlights the interest of combining osseo-integration with an automatic control strategy for intermediate joints in terms of compensatory movement reduction and control intuitiveness gain.}

abstract = {Objective
A gap has been growing between the mechanical features of newly commercialized prosthetic devices and the control strategies available to the users. The prosthetic joints are controlled sequentially via myoelectric control, and each actuation requires the user's attention. Because of a complex control scheme, transhumeral amputees are generally equipped with a 1-degree-of-freedom myoelectric hand, a myoelectric wrist rotator, and a manually locked elbow. The prosthetic forearm position, adjusted before the movement, is not involved in the overall upper limb movements, resulting in the development of compensatory strategies. A promising solution to improve prosthetic control utilizes the residual limb motions to control the elbow. Previous studies have shown that elbow motion could be predicted from measures of the residual limb movements and an inter-joint coordination model. This study is the first to report the utilization of an automatically driven prosthetic elbow by a transhumeral amputee.
Material/patients and methods
The participant pointed at targets with a prosthesis prototype including a modified motorized elbow. The prosthetic elbow motion was derived from a generic model of inter-joint coordinations, and IMU-based residual limb measurements. The participant performed also the task with the prosthetic elbow implemented with his own myoelectric control strategy. Body movements were assessed with the data recorded with a motion capture system.
Results
The patient achieved the pointing task with a better precision when the elbow was myoelectrically-driven. However, these movements required important trunk compensations. Trunk movements were smaller with residual limb motion-based elbow control, which enabled a more natural overall body behavior with synchronous shoulder and elbow motions. Due to socket impairment, but also to post-amputation body scheme modifications and discrepancies between healthy and artificial limbs, the participant's residual limb amplitudes were different of the ones of healthy shoulder movements for the same tasks.
Discussion – conclusion
This work questions the paradigm whereby a prosthetic elbow can be intuitively and naturally used by an amputee while its motion is derived from healthy individual data. Although there is a need for novel modeling approaches to build an inter-joint coordination model adapted to each user, residual limb motion-driven prosthetic elbow enables simultaneous control of elbow and end-effector, and restores a more natural body behavior.}

  abstract  = {Recent advances in mechatronics and robotics have led to the production of prostheses with a growing number of active degrees of freedom (DoFs). Unfortunately, the gap is growing between this improved hardware and their still counter-intuitive, sequential and limited myoelectric control. To overcome some of these control limitations, there is a renewal of interest in using movements rather than electrophysiological signals as control inputs. Among those movement-based control approaches, some aim to create a more intuitive and natural control by using the motion of the residual limb and body to predict and automatize partly the movement of the prosthesis. Such control rely on the use of models of natural interjoint coordination which naturally exists in healthy subjects.
We thus here propose to use Radial Basis Function Networks (RBFN) to estimate flexion/extension prosthetic elbow movements from the residual shoulder angular movements, measured with embedded Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs). The performance of this control model was assessed with an experimental evaluation with 3 transhumeral amputated participants who used this automatically driven elbow prosthesis (and a generic myoelectric control for comparison) to perform reaching tasks. The automatic control mode relied on a generic model of the shoulder-elbow coordination which was built from data obtained from a group of healthy subjects. Several metrics were thus used to quantify the task performance, along with the movement strategies exhibited by the amputated participants to illustrate the possibilities and present limitations of such control approaches.

  abstract  = {Next generation prosthetics will rely massively on myoelectric "Pattern Recognition" (PR) based control approaches, as proposed with the Ottobock Myo Plus system. Those uses multiple recording electrodes and complex machine learning algorithms to recognize multiple muscle activation patterns and increase user dexterity. One major factor  of  successful functioning of these approaches lies in the training of amputated users and in their understanding of how those works. We thus propose here an intuitive visual biofeedback which can be easily used to train amputated subjects and allow them to learn to adapt and modulate their muscular contractions to improve their control performance.  
An experimental campaign was conducted on 8 healthy subjects and 1 transradial amputee, fitted with a 8 channel myoelectric recording system. Their performance in controlling an interface through a myoelectric PR algorithm were evaluated; before and after a short (3 minutes) automatic user training session consisting in using the proposed visual biofeedback for one group, and using a generic PR algorithm output feedback for the control group. The objective was to train the most problematic gesture. Differences in the variations of performance before and after this user's training sessions are then analysed to evaluate the potential of the proposed approach.
Participants trained with the proposed biofeedback increased their classification score for the retrained gesture by 27%, with an improvement of the after-training average global successful classification rate of 8.8% (final overall score of 93%). The control group obtained an increase of 49% for the retrained gesture, but with a global increase of 1.9% (final overall score of 75%). Analysis of the variations of the average myoelectric patterns (RMS values of the myoelectric activity across the channels) for the trained gesture before and after training indicates a clear change in contraction strategy only in the group who used the proposed biofeedback.
The preliminary results obtained highlight the potential of this method which does not focus so much on over-optimizing the pattern recognition algorithm or on physically training the users than on providing them simple and intuitive information to adapt or even radically change their motor strategies to solve some misclassification issues. While future work should be focused on the experimental evaluation on more amputated users, we believe that such biofeedback could pave the road toward generic tools for prosthetists to train the amputees who will be fitted, in a near future, with the new generation of myoelectric pattern recognition controlled prostheses.},
